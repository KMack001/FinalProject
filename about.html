                              The pandemic has generated a lot of buzz. When a new pair of sneakers is released, it is always a hot topic on social media.
                              Because of the pandemic, activities like Sneaker Con are canceled. Sneaker enthusiasts were able to express themselves as well as sell and buy shoes at these gatherings.
                              Why not allow sneaker collectors to ethically sell, purchase, exchange, and discuss their collections virtually?
                              The goal will be to develop a mobile-friendly social platform where people can chat about sneakers and buy and sell them.
                              Sneaker collectors will be able to purchase, sell, trade, and discuss their collections.
                              Collectors will be able to interact with those in their area via this platform.
                              Users would be able to connect with anyone within a 100-mile radius and meet up to sell or purchase sneakers.
                              Sneaker collectors will be able to express themselves and discuss new sneaker releases as well as their views on shoe styles.
                              The website will also include information on how to buy sneakers for various retailers, restocks, and sneaker sales.
